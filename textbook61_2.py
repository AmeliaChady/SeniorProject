'''
In the list of intervals, finds the interval that has its end time closest to the start time of the interval at index.
Note: In event of ties, the higher index is picked.
Note: Assumes list is ordered least to greatest in end times.

interval_list: intervals to look through
index: the index the interval to check against is stored in.

'''
Weighted Interval Scheduling - Recursive

Takes in a list of intervals ordered least to greatest in end times
Returns a list of the subset of intervals with the greatest weight and no overlap.
